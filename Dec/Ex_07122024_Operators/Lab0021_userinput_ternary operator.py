# program is if ur age is greater than 18 - allowed to vote
# else -> not allowed to


user_age = int(input("Enter your age\n"))

# if user_age>18:
#     print("yes you can vote")
# else:
#     print(" you cannot vote")


# Ternary
print("yes you can vote" if user_age>18 else " you cannot vote"

# not to write one line code like below because it is confusing
# print("yes you can vote" if int(input("Enter your age\n"))>18 else " you cannot vote" )
